            <p>If you have ever wondered what could happen if Sum 41 met Eve in an Anime convention then Sheru! has the
              answer for you. A Mexican songwriter that couldn’t help but create rock-pop music inspired by the stories
              embedded in anime, manga, and light novels; meet the story of Sheru!</p>
            <p>“I’ll be lying to myself if I didn’t say that anime and manga changed my life”. The first time he listen
              to an opening of an anime he couldn’t help but dance to it. He calls himself the otaku minstrel of the
              21st century. Sheru! wants to share the experiences given by this culture with the world.</p>
            <p>Ricardo is a guy whose direction of his life would’ve been the one of an engineer. He got his ideas clear
              thanks to his friends and teachers that knew what drives him perfectly, the music. Although his fear and
              anxiety raised as he walked the path of an independent artist, he never regret the decision he made. The
              name “Sheru!” it’s inspired by the translation in Japanese of his nickname and surname “Concha”. That’s
              how a fan he is of the Japanese culture.</p>
            <p>He’s currently releasing singles every 4-6 weeks and these will form his first album (which name It’s not
              announced yet, yep, it’s a secret). This album wants to spread the idea of what people are capable of,
              inspired by webtoons and mangas such as Unordinary, Refund Highschool, Jujutsu Kaisen among other ones.
            </p>
            <p>“There’s more in anime, manga, and light novels than just ‘drawings’, I even can’t understand why I
              prefer this to any other movie or series out there. But one thing is sure, I connect with it deeply.”
              Sheru! wants to share with the people the love he has with this culture and maybe, you can also find
              something interesting in his music. Maybe it can expand your world, maybe it can change your mind, maybe
              it will just make you dance, whatever it is, the otaku minstrel will be grateful if you want to be a
              companion on this trip.</p>
