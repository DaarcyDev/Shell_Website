            <div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix">
              <p>It’s cool to think that when someone has any kind of “power” they will use it to help others. That’s
                not always the case. And that is the main idea behind the story of this song.</p>
              <p>Our main character has the power to probably change the world he lives in, but because of childhood
                traumas, he decided to seal it to protect everyone from him. He has a complicated past that he doesn’t
                share with anyone, even with his best friend. He was forced to use his power to protect himself from a
                life or death situation, provoked by one of his acquaintances (let’s say, a leader or a figure of
                power in the society in his life). Because the secret is leaked, our main character is slowly
                transforming into a merciless, violent life being that causes pain to the people around him.</p>
              <p>We all have personal problems that mold our personalities. Of course, you can improve yourself by
                confronting them, forgive them, or changing your perspective. But sometimes, people will need a friend
                (“luck” because there are people that don’t have anyone to get support from) to change/improve into a
                better version.</p>
